# StarMap

An interactive 3D map of the Spore galaxy. The data comes from `stars.db`, which is where the game stores information about generated star systems.

## Controls
Control the camera using the mouse.
* **Left Click + Drag** to rotate
* **Right Click + Drag** to pan
* **Scroll Wheel** to zoom in/out

## Notes
* Each dot is a single star system, black holes, or proto-planetary disk. 
* The galaxy is naturally very flat, so the y-axis is inflated in the renderer to make the stars appear slightly more spread-out.
